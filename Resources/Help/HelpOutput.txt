Usage:
  fitoolkit.exe (--help | --version | --set-config="<path>" [--generate-config]) [--no-exit=<N>]
 
Command-line options:
  --help
      Prints this information.
  --version
      Prints current application version.
  --set-config="<path>"
      Specifies application configuration file.
      <path> value can be either absolute or relative.
      The file determined by a <path> value must exist or be writable.
  --generate-config
      This flag enables a default configuration file generation.
      If it set then a configuration file will be created at a path determined
      by "--set-config" option. The generated file contains default values and
      mostly is an example, i.e. not applicable for real application usage.
  --no-exit=<N>
      This option prevents application termination.
      <N> is a number which can take the following values:
        0 - disabled, application will terminate automatically.
        1 - enabled, application won't terminate automatically.
        2 - enabled, application won't terminate automatically only in case
            of exception.
